   abstract = {From the Publisher:Realistic Ray Tracing is an innovative, in-depth look at the theory and techniques of ray tracing, a method of producing photorealistic computer graphics images by applying simple algorithms. This book will guide you through the steps of creating your own powerful ray tracer program, proceeding from simple images through advanced special effects such as soft shadows, glass and metal textures, and motion blur. It concentrates on the nuts and bolts of writing ray tracing programs, with plenty of practical, detail-oriented how-to advice and careful attention to the underlying theory.}
