This book will guide you through the steps of creating your own powerful ray tracer program, proceeding from simple images through advanced special effects such as soft shadows, glass and metal textures, and motion blur. It concentrates on the nuts and bolts of writing ray tracing programs, with plenty of practical, detail-oriented how-to advice and careful attention to the underlying theory.},

  abstract   = {Recently a breakthrough has occurred in graphics hardware: fixed function pipelines have been replaced with programmable vertex and fragment processors. In the near future, the graphics pipeline is likely to evolve into a general programmable stream processor capable of more than simply feed-forward triangle rendering.In this paper, we evaluate these trends in programmability of the graphics pipeline and explain how ray tracing can be mapped to graphics hardware. Using our simulator, we analyze the performance of a ray casting implementation on next generation programmable graphics hardware. In addition, we compare the performance difference between non-branching programmable hardware using a multipass implementation and an architecture that supports branching. We also show how this approach is applicable to other ray tracing algorithms such as Whitted ray tracing, path tracing, and hybrid rendering algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that ray tracing on graphics hardware could prove to be faster than CPU based implementations as well as competitive with traditional hardware accelerated feed-forward triangle rendering.},

  abstract = {Abstract: A new BRDF model is presented which can be viewed as an kind of intermediary model between empirism and theory. Main results of physics are observed (energy conservation, reciprocity rule, microfacet theory) and numerous phenomena involved in light reflection are accounted for, in a physically plausible way (incoherent and coherent reflection, spectrum modifications, anisotropy, self-shadowing, multiple surface and subsurface reflection, differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous materials). The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features: simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a two pass global illumination method based on the concept of photon maps. It represents a significant improvement of a previously described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from the light sources and storing these as they hit surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution caustics photon map to render caustics that are visualized directly and one low resolution photon map that is used during the rendering step. The scene is rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm optimized by using the information in the photon maps. Shadow photons are used to render shadows more efficiently and the directional information in the photon map is used to generate optimized sampling directions and to limit the recursion in the distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular and highly glossy surfaces.},
